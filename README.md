# Netflix-Finance-Data
The Multi-Cloud Web Application is designed to calculate the risk associated with certain trading signals of Netflix's financial data using Monte Carlo Simulation. The application caters to the need for a scalable system with rapid elasticity using cloud services such as Amazon Web Service(AWS) Lambda and AWS EC2 and Google App Engine (GAE0 for determining the risk involved.

The application is divided into two parts – Front End and Back End. For the back end, Google App Engine (GAE) is used to host the web-application, Flask – a micro web framework to develop the web-application, AWS Lambda and AWS Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) to calculate the risk values associated with each trading signal, and AWS S3 for storing the historical analysis of the user. Parallelisation of EC2 and Lambda is configured in GAE to reduce the response time for the user. 
For the front end, HTML and CSS is used to design multiple web pages which gives the user the flexibility to choose the scalable service (Lambda or EC2) to calculate the risk values, freedom to specify the number of resources, minimum days of data to be analysed and type of signal (buy or sell). Based on the inputs and selection made on the HTML webpages, GAE will select the type of scalable service to runthe risk calculation on. Further, using Image Charts, the user is presented with the complete analysis with a table and a graph of risk involved in the type of trading signal the user selects.
